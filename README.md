# Tailwind CSS

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a large collection of pre-built classes to style your HTML without writing custom CSS for most cases.

### Key points:

- No need to write separate CSS files — style directly in your HTML with ready-to-use utility classes.
- Single-purpose classes — each class does exactly one thing (e.g., `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, `mt-4`).
- No CSS overrides — reduces complexity and style conflicts.
- Faster development — quickly build responsive, modern designs without switching between HTML and CSS files.
- Optimized performance — purges unused styles in production, keeping CSS small and fast.

## Setting up Tailwind with CDN

1. Use any code editor like **VS Code**.
2. Create an HTML file and write basic HTML structure.
3. Go to [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/) and search for **Play CDN** and copy the script tag link.
4. Add the CDN `<script>` link inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
5. Add your HTML body content and use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
6. Run the HTML file in your browser.
7. (Optional) Download Tailwind CSS code for offline use.

**Note:**  
You can also install the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension in VS Code for autocompletion, but it will not work with the CDN method — it requires a local Tailwind setup.

## Question: What is the core principle behind Tailwind CSS?

**Answer:**  
The core principle of Tailwind CSS is **"Utility-First"** — styling is done using small, single-purpose classes that each apply a specific CSS property, allowing you to compose designs directly in HTML without writing separate CSS files.
