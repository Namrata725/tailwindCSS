# Tailwind CSS

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a large collection of pre-built classes to style your HTML without writing custom CSS for most cases.

### Key points:

- No need to write separate CSS files — style directly in your HTML with ready-to-use utility classes.
- Single-purpose classes — each class does exactly one thing (e.g., `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, `mt-4`).
- No CSS overrides — reduces complexity and style conflicts.
- Faster development — quickly build responsive, modern designs without switching between HTML and CSS files.
- Optimized performance — purges unused styles in production, keeping CSS small and fast.
