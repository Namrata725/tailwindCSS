# Tailwind CSS

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a large collection of pre-built classes to style your HTML without writing custom CSS for most cases.

### Key points:

- No need to write separate CSS files — style directly in your HTML with ready-to-use utility classes.
- Single-purpose classes — each class does exactly one thing (e.g., `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, `mt-4`).
- No CSS overrides — reduces complexity and style conflicts.
- Faster development — quickly build responsive, modern designs without switching between HTML and CSS files.
- Optimized performance — purges unused styles in production, keeping CSS small and fast.

## Setting up Tailwind with CDN

1. Use any code editor like **VS Code**.
2. Create an HTML file and write basic HTML structure.
3. Go to [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/) and search for **Play CDN** and copy the script tag link.
4. Add the CDN `<script>` link inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
5. Add your HTML body content and use Tailwind utility classes for styling.
6. Run the HTML file in your browser.
7. (Optional) Download Tailwind CSS code for offline use.

**Note:**  
You can also install the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension in VS Code for autocompletion, but it will not work with the CDN method — it requires a local Tailwind setup.

## Question: What is the core principle behind Tailwind CSS?

**Answer:**  
The core principle of Tailwind CSS is **"Utility-First"** — styling is done using small, single-purpose classes that each apply a specific CSS property, allowing you to compose designs directly in HTML without writing separate CSS files.

# Tailwind CSS v4 Setup with CLI

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed.  
  Download from: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

---

## Steps to Set Up Tailwind CSS v4 with CLI

1. **Install Tailwind CSS** in your project folder:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
   ```
   This will create:

- `node_modules/` — contains all installed dependencies.
- `package.json` — project metadata and dependencies list.
- `package-lock.json` — exact versions of installed dependencies.

2. **Create an input CSS file** (e.g., src/input.css) and import Tailwind:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

3. **Generate the output CSS file** and watch for changes:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

- Replace `src/input.css` and `src/output.css` with your preferred file paths.
- If your CSS is inside a subfolder, include the folder name in the command:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./folder-name/input.css -o ./folder-name/output.css --watch
```

4. Create your HTML file and link the generated `output.css:`

```html
<link href="./output.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

5. **Enable IntelliSense** in VS Code by installing the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** extension for class name suggestions.

### Example Tailwind Element

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 text-center">
  Hello world!
</h1>
```

**This uses:**

- `text-3xl`large font size
- `font-bold`bold text
- `bg-blue-500`blue background
- `text-white` white text color
- `p-4` padding
- `text-center` center-aligned text

## Question:

1. **Features of Tailwind CSS**

- Utility-first CSS framework with single-purpose classes.
- Mobile-first responsive design utilities.
- Highly customizable via configuration.
- Removes unused CSS in production builds for smaller file size.
- Encourages consistency and speeds up development.
- Works well with any frontend framework or plain HTML.

2. What is the work of `output.css?`

`output.css` is the compiled CSS file generated by Tailwind’s CLI.
It contains:

- All Tailwind’s prebuilt utility classes.
- Any additional custom styles you have added.

You link `output.css` in your HTML so the browser can apply Tailwind styles to your elements.

# First Style with Tailwind CSS

## Start with a Basic Header

We begin by creating a simple navigation header.  
Below are two approaches:

1. **Core CSS** – using custom styles written in a `<style>` block or `.css` file.
2. **Tailwind CSS** – using utility classes directly in HTML.

## How Tailwind CSS Works

Tailwind CSS applies styles using small, single-purpose classes that correspond to specific CSS properties.  
Instead of writing custom CSS rules, you combine utility classes in your HTML to build designs quickly.

Example:

```html
<ul class="bg-black text-white m-0 flex">
  ...
</ul>
```

- `bg-black ` sets background color to black.
- `text-white` sets text color to white.
- `m-0` removes margin.
- `flex` makes the container a flexbox.

## Comparison: Core CSS vs Tailwind CSS Header

**Core CSS Example** `(not-tailwind.html)`

- Requires defining CSS selectors in a <style> block or .css file.
- Styles are written once and applied to matching elements.
- Hover effects require writing separate CSS rules.

**Tailwind CSS Example** (`index.html`)

- No separate CSS file needed for basic styling.
- Styles are applied directly using Tailwind utility classes.
- Hover effects are applied using `hover:` prefix (e.g., `hover:bg-zinc-800`).
- Child styling can be applied using arbitrary variants like `[&>*]:flex`.

**Testing the Header**

- Open `not-tailwind.html` in the browser to see the plain CSS version.
- Open `index.html` to see the Tailwind CSS version.
- Resize the browser or inspect elements to understand how classes apply styles instantly.

## Questions

**How many pixels are in 1rem?**

By default in most browsers,` 1rem = 16px`.
This value is based on the root (`<html>`) font size, which can be changed via CSS.

**How to apply style to a child element in Tailwind CSS?**

You can use arbitrary variants with the [`&>*`] syntax.

**Example:**

```html
<ul class="[&>*]:flex">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

This applies `display: flex` to `all direct children` of the `<ul>` element.
